# AdHawk Field Guide

Welcome to AdHawk!

The "Field Guide" is an attempt to write down what was previously an oral
history. There is a wealth of knowledge and history buried in the minds of
'Hawks, so over time you can help the Field Guide grow and flourish.

If you are new, please take the time to read the guide and make pull-requests
to clarify things. Also, use your freshness to question our "traditions". We're
friendly folk that love feedback!
