# Core Values

## Beginner's Mindset

As AdHawk engineers, we are committed to continuous learning and growth. We
strive to keep a "beginner's mindset" regardless of our title or skill level. A
beginner's mindset allows us to always learn from the experiences and knowledge
of others. As we become more experienced, the beginner's mindset keeps us
humble and able to mentor others on our team. We approach situations with an
eagerness to learn and understand, rather than to be understood. We ask questions 
without fear and we answer them with humility.

## Hustle

There is no replacement for hard-work. Not intelligence, not luck, nor
happenstance. In order to grow at AdHawk, we put in the legwork.

## Clarity

Whether it be in code or communication, we strive for clarity. We write
friendly and easy-to-understand code so that the next person to touch it has a
positive experience.

When we encounter something unclear along the way, we take that oppurtunity to
refactor. Every "room" we leave is cleaner than when we entered. We maintain thorough test coverage in order to make this possible.

## Teamwork

At AdHawk, we strive our hardest to lift people up and work together to solve
problems. We share our successes as well as our shortcomings. We take the time
to help others learn new concepts and best practices knowing that, in the end,
it will serve to benefit the team.
