# Core Values

## Beginner's Mindset

As AdHawk engineers, we are committed to continuous learning and growth. We
strive to keep a "beginner's mindset" regardless of our title or skill level. A
beginner's mindset allows us to always learn from the experiences and knowledge
of others. As we become more experienced, the beginner's mindset keeps us
humble and able to mentor others on our team. We approach situations with an
eagerness to learn and understand, rather than to be understood. We ask questions
without fear and we answer them with humility.

- [ ] Took code reviews to heart and implemented the requested changes
- [ ] Learned from code reviews and applied knowledge to newly written code
- [ ] Respected opinions of other teammates even when they disagreed
- [ ] Took the time to teach teammates something that they learned

## Hustle

There is no replacement for hard-work. Not intelligence, not luck, nor
happenstance. In order to grow at AdHawk, we put in the legwork.

"Hustle makes up for many mistakes" - TS

- [ ] Added features
- [ ] Showed a regular git commit log of daily output
- [ ] Finished out the "Last 10%" of a PR in a timely fashion
- [ ] Went the extra mile to open-source changes which could benefit others

## Clarity

Whether it be in code or communication, we strive for clarity. We write
friendly and easy-to-understand code so that the next person to touch it has a
positive experience.

When we encounter something unclear along the way, we take that oppurtunity to
refactor. Every "room" we leave is cleaner than when we entered. We maintain
thorough test coverage in order to make this possible.

- [ ] Improved "legacy code" when implemented new features

## Teamwork

At AdHawk, we strive our hardest to lift people up and work together to solve
problems. We share our successes as well as our shortcomings. We take the time
to help others learn new concepts and best practices knowing that, in the end,
it will serve to benefit the team.
