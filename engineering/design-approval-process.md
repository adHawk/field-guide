# Design Approval Process

The design approval process we use is meant to facilitate communication between
designers and engineers throughout a feature lifecycle. The goal of the process
is to be a guide rather than a ceremony, so please take only what you need from it.

We have found that these three basic points of contact between engineering and
design are incredibly valuable.

## Outline

1. Lo-Mid-Fi meeting
   - Designer presents mockups, engineering gives feedback
   - Discuss potential issues with deadlines
2. Hi-Fi meeting
   - Designer presents mockups on zeplin, comments are very encourages
   - Potential scope issues/deadlines/v2s will be addressed to PM
   - Assets (SVG, fonts, example images, etc) provided at this meeting
3. Implementation Meeting
   - Engineer presents relevant changes, designer gives feedback
     - This can be done either with an impromptu meeting or a GitHub PR
   - PR gets approved / commented on by designer
   - PRs should follow some basic rules:
     - Great description, noting the portions of the PR you want the designer
       to look at
     - A link to the staging site ideally, or screenshots otherwise
     - Try to keep the communication public, i.e. prefer asking specific
       question on the GitHub PR rather than Slack so other teammates can
       benefit from the communication.
